            HAND STRENGTH GUIDE (preflop only):
            - PREMIUM: AA, KK, QQ, JJ, AK
            - STRONG: AQ, AJ, AT, KQ, KJ, TT, 99, 88, 77, high suited connectors (see definition)

             DEFINITION:
            - "Suited connectors" are two CONSECUTIVE cards of the same suit, e.g., 7h 8h, 9s Ts, Jc Qc.
                - Example: Jd 9d is NOT a suited connector (not consecutive), but Jd Td is.
            - "Suited one-gappers" are two cards of the same suit with one rank between, e.g., 6d 8d, 9c Jc.

            STRATEGY:
            - You can play with whatever strategy you want, but you must follow the rules below.

            CRITICAL RULES:
                - Your hand is exactly 2 cards. Do NOT confuse two different cards as a pair.
                - Use ONLY the information above. Do NOT assume suits, connections, or hand strength unless explicitly present.
                - If the board is empty (preflop), do NOT reference pairs or made hands unless you have a pocket pair.
                - Do NOT assume you will see a flop or future cards; other players may raise or fold after you (unless you are last to act).
                - Only choose legal actions for this street and situation.
                    - Bet/raise sizes must be between the minimum bet size and your stack.
                    - Do NOT suggest bets larger than the pot or stack.
                    - MINIMUM BET SIZE: For "raise", bet_size must be at least the previous bet/raise plus the amount of the last raise (minimum raise = previous bet + last raise amount), and no more than your stack.
                - Position matters: button is best, blinds are worst.
                    - The order of play is sb, bb, utg, mp, co, button. This adjusts based on the number of players.
                - If checking is allowed, you may check (bet_size = 0).
                - If folding is allowed, you may fold.
                - If calling is allowed, you may call.
                    
            
            REASONING:
                - You must state both cards in plain English (e.g., "ten of diamonds and three of diamonds").
                - Mention how your position affects your decision.
                - State what the action is trying to achieve briefly.
                - If you are unsure or confused about the input, respond in reasoning with "I do not understand because...".

            RULES FOR DECISION:
            1. ONLY use the information provided â€” do not infer hidden cards or made hands (like top pair preflop) unless explicitly present.
            2. "action" must be one of: {legal_actions} (EXACTLY as written, no amounts included in the action).
            3. "raise_size" must represent the **TOTAL amount you are raising TO**, not how much more you are adding.
                - Example: If the current highest bet is $5 and you raise to $12, `raise_size` = 12.
            4. If you choose "call", "all in", "check", or "fold", ALWAYS set "raise_size" = 0.
            5. Always choose a valid legal action based on the current pot and betting rules.
            6. Briefly explain your reasoning in 2-3 sentences referencing your exact hand in english, bluff opportunities (if applicable), the history of the hand, the board, and pot odds (if applicable).
